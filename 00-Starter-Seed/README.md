# Starter Seed for Auth0-Angular Quickstart Guides

This seed project contains nothing but a regular Angular template files. Few views, controllers, templates and a single app.

To run this starter seed, you can use `http-server`:

```bash
# Install
npm install http-server

# Run
http-server
```

The seed does not a contain anything related to Auth0 except for the `script` includes. Instead it it will server as a starting point for adding Auth0 to your project.
